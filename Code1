 *You want to decide whether you should drive your car to work or take the train. 
 *You know the one-way distance from your home to your place of work (73 miles) , 
 *and the fuel efficiency of your car (in miles per gallon) (18 MPG).
  *You also know the one-way price of a train ticket($20.00). 
  *You assume the cost of gas at $4 per gallon, and car maintenance at 5 cents per mile.
  *Write an application named TravelDecider to decide which commute is cheaper
